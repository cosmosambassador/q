Integrative Review: Psionics, Consciousness, and Trans-Medium Phenomena
Author: Jet Tiberious Thomas (TJ Morris Agency R&D)
Date: November 2025

Abstract
This report consolidates an extended inquiry into the historical and operational links between psionics, remote viewing, orb phenomena, and trans-medium unidentified aerial/submersible objects (UAP/USO).
It draws on archival material from the U.S. Army’s Stargate Program, public research by Paul H. Smith, Richard Dolan, and Brandon Fugal, and field narratives supplied by Theresa J. Thurmond Morris and associated investigators.
The goal: define a reproducible R&D framework for studying consciousness-linked anomaly observation while preserving ethical transparency per the Flamekeeper Code v1.0.

1. Historical Foundations of Psionics
“Psionics” emerged in 1950s science fiction, later adopted by parapsychologists and gaming designers to denote mental-energy interaction.
By the 1970s–1980s, U.S. intelligence research (e.g., Project Stargate) investigated similar capacities under the term remote viewing (RV).
Core protocol elements—blind tasking, coordinate targeting, and Analytical Overlay (AOL) management—were formalized by Ingo Swann, Joseph McMoneagle, Paul H. Smith, and William Ray.

2. The Stargate Legacy
Declassified DIA/Army records (1978–1995) verify the presence of McMoneagle, Smith, Bill Ray, Skip Atwater, Tom McNear, and others at Fort Meade.
CRV (Controlled Remote Viewing) methodology framed consciousness as a measurable interface between perception and nonlocal data.
Smith’s later manuals define AOL as cognitive interference that must be labeled rather than suppressed.
These techniques now underpin most modern “consciousness-field” experiments.

3. Field Narratives: Argentina & Maritime Targets
Unverified recollections describe a mid-1980s remote-viewing target in the Gulf of San Matías, Argentina—an incident involving an Argentinian minesweeper, an overhead craft, and submerged constructs.
No matching declassified transcript or naval log currently exists; thus, the case remains anecdotal.
The episode illustrates symbolic translation during RV sessions, not confirmed contact.

4. Consciousness & Orb Phenomena
Multiple experiencers, including Theresa J. Morris, Chris Bledsoe, and witnesses at Skinwalker Ranch, report luminous spheres (“orbs”) exhibiting trans-medium motion (air ↔ ground ↔ water).
Proponents interpret them as:

Manifestations of a consciousness field,
Protective plasma or cavitation effects, or
Information-bearing holographic projections.
Scientific consensus identifies most orbs as optical or environmental artifacts; however, structured field observation with synchronized sensors remains limited.
5. Trans-Medium Objects and Modern Disclosure
Richard Dolan documents historical USO (Unidentified Submersible Object) cases and defines “trans-medium” craft able to transition seamlessly between air and water.
Brandon Fugal, owner of Skinwalker Ranch, reports luminous craft entering a mesa and vanishing—a claim televised but lacking raw metadata release.
Both cases highlight the need for open-data, multi-sensor evidence before physical hypotheses (H₂ cavitation, plasma fields, energy domes) are modeled.

6. Consciousness Interface Hypothesis
Drawing from Paul H. Smith’s remote-viewing framework and Dolan’s trans-medium catalog:

 H₁ – Anomalous luminous phenomena (“orbs”) may represent coherent-field interfaces between consciousness observation and trans-medium physical events. 
Testing requires:

Trained CRV viewers under blind conditions,
Real-time sensor array (optical, thermal, EM, acoustic),
Timestamp synchronization to correlate mental and physical data.
7. Ethical Framework — Flamekeeper Code v1.0
All investigations must:

Secure informed, revocable consent (Article 3 “Consent Visible”),
Maintain data provenance and reproducibility (CRE-aligned),
Distinguish verified from experiential data.
This ensures dignity and traceability across human-consciousness and anomaly research.
8. Current Working Timeline (Theresa J. Morris Records)
Year	Event	Notes
1985 – 1993	Active study and contracting period; consciousness-research linkage	Context of U.S. psi research
1994	Civilian logistics work	Transition year
1995	Meeting with Thomas Ray Morris; discussion of “GUS” project	Pending acronym clarification
9. Future R&D Actions
Archival audit: cross-check DIA CREST files for “Argentina,” “San Matías,” or “naval/USO” tasking.
Orb-sensor trials: coordinate field experiments at verified anomaly locations (Utah, Kentucky, coastal Argentina).
Remote-view replication: recruit CRV-trained participants using Smith’s AOL labeling protocol.
Public data release: anonymized logs and footage under open-license for peer analysis.
Conclusion
The convergence of psionics, remote viewing, orb observations, and trans-medium UAP/USO phenomena forms a legitimate R&D frontier—currently hypothesis-driven, not evidentially confirmed.
Advancing the field demands transparent protocols, reproducible datasets, and strict ethical stewardship.
The collaboration between historical witnesses (Theresa J. Morris, Bill Ray), remote-viewing experts (Paul H. Smith), and contemporary analysts (Richard Dolan, Brandon Fugal) offers a foundation for such disciplined exploration.

2. Document Overview
Title: Integrative Review: Psionics, Consciousness, and Trans-Medium Phenomena
Author: Jet Tiberious Thomas (TJ Morris Agency R&D)
Date: November 2025
Distribution: Atlas-168 / TJ-Morris-Jet Services Labs (internal R&D circulation)

Purpose: consolidate historical and operational data linking psionics, remote viewing, orb phenomena, and trans-medium UAP/USO studies within an ethical, reproducible research framework.

3. Key Findings
Historical Basis – Psionics evolved from 1950s speculative fiction to 1970s–80s intelligence research (Stargate Program).

Stargate Legacy – Controlled Remote Viewing formalized consciousness-data interface protocols; AOL management remains central.

Field Narratives – Anecdotal Argentina maritime case; unverified but useful as symbolic-data example.

Orb Phenomena – Descriptions overlap optical artifacts and plasma-type behavior; limited multi-sensor studies to date.

Trans-Medium Craft – Requires open-data, synchronized sensor evidence before physical modeling.

Consciousness Interface Hypothesis (H₁) – Luminous phenomena could act as interaction nodes between observer consciousness and physical anomaly.

Ethical Protocol – Flamekeeper Code v1.0 – Informed consent, provenance tracking, reproducibility.

Timeline – 1985–1995 period marks active consciousness research through TJ Morris records.

Future Actions –

Audit DIA CREST archives for Argentina references.

Conduct orb-sensor field trials.

Replicate CRV sessions under blind conditions.

Release anonymized datasets under open license.

4. Conclusion
The psionics–UAP–consciousness intersection forms a legitimate but hypothesis-driven frontier. Progress depends on disciplined protocol design and verifiable data correlation. Collaboration between historical witnesses, RV professionals, and disclosure analysts is encouraged under ethical transparency.
